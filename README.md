# Whereisit GPS

### Description 
A web application for business owners who want to track their vehicles and manage their drivers in real time. 

### Why build this?
I know this product really well. Look at my resume. You'll understand why. I love cars. I like software that plays in the real and digital world (as a hobby mostly). With domain knowledge on lock, I could focus on the process of building a full stack application. React really came to life. Node made bouncing from frontend to backend seamless. It was a really fun project. Also I'm not aware of a complete, out of the box fleet manager built with a contemporary stack quite like this, just on github, that isn't intended to be a modular piece of something else. This is approaching a functional beta product. I'm reasonably certain users would pay for a system like this although I have no intention follow that path with this project. This was just for the boot camp.
